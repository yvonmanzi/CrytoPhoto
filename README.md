# CryptoPhoto

CrytoPhoto is a decentralized application(dapp) built on top of [OpenSea.js](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-js/), a Javascript SDK for [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) that allows users to buy, sell, and bid on crypto photos 

# How to run it

Execute **nvm use**, if you have Node Version Manager, or install Node.js version 8.11 to make sure dependencies work.

Then, to install dependencies:

`npm install `

To run the app on localhost:

`npm start`

To minify and create a production build:

`npm run build`

# Directory structure
**public** houses favicon and base index.html â€“ there should be little reason to use this directory.

**src** contains the app's js entry point and a simple CSS file.
